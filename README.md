The toy industry uses 40 tons of plastic for every $1 million in revenues and is the most plastic-intensive industry in the world. 90% of the toys on the market are made of plastic. Plastic toys can contain heavy metals such as lead or cadmium or other harmful chemicals such as dioxins.

“The toy industry is the most plastic intensive industry in the world”.


For centuries, people have shared and exchanged goods and services within their communities. Recently, this idea has received a modern boost thanks to the internet.


The Toy-Cycle site is straightforward and easy to use. A parent who wants to get rid of an unwanted toy takes a picture of it and posts it on the site. Any other parent participating in the program — within the same geographic area — can then reply to the post and arrange a time and place to pick the toy up. There is no exchange of money or shipping. Alternatively, parents can also post items they want for their children.

While Toy Cycle seems like a great idea for parents, kids may be a bit more skeptical about giving away their beloved toys. Collins explains that initially kids haven't been excited about the idea. However after explaining that they can get a new toy in exchange, they quickly warmed to the idea and couldn’t wait to find a toy to give away.
